# Movie-Search

A React application built with Vite for searching movies.

## Project Setup

This project uses Vite for a fast development experience with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and includes ESLint rules for code quality.

Currently, two official Vite plugins are available for React:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Development

To run locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
